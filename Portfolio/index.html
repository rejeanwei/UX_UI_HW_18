                        <b>My Skills </b> <br><br>
                        <b>User research:</b> Starting with a proto persona, I learn what sort of needs and what to prioritize for my users. From there I conduct interviews and secondary research to back up my findings.
               <br> <br> <b>User empathy:</b> By emphasizing and connecting with my clients during user interviews, I apply their frustrations into changes within my projects. 
               <br> <br><b> Qualitative interviews:</b> I like to approach qualitative interviews by focusing on the “why” aspect. Typically I like to ask questions such as “Why was this done this way?” to gauge the thinking behind my clients and how to approach that.

                    Given an objective to design a product to help people with their everyday problems, our team designed BabyThrift. BabyThrift is an app that sells maternity and baby clothing using a subscription based model. This was my first group project where our team had to display teamwork, communication and operate together in order to create a truly great project.                     </p>
